# Serenade Graph Dependency Analyzer
This is a script I wrote that can identify the dependencies for each file in a codebaseâ€”using
tree-sitter. It's a command-line utility that takes as an
argument a path to some directory, as well as a file to analyze, and then
outputs what other files are imported for each file in that directory.

A few things to note:
- The analyzer shows the entire chain (run `./demo.py ./tests/foo.py`)
- The analyzer designates unused packages
- The analyzer designates `stdlib` packages
- The analyzer is able to handle aliasing and multiple packages imported in one line
- The analyzer is able to output the specific functions being called in the designated package (bracketed)
- The analyzer supports python3 code
